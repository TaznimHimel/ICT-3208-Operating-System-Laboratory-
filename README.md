# ICT-3208 â€” Operating System Laboratory

This repository contains lab solutions and code implementations for the **Operating System Laboratory (ICT-3208)** course.  
It covers **all major CPU scheduling algorithms** along with **basic Linux commands and operations** for practical OS learning.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents

### 1. CPU Scheduling Algorithms
- **First Come First Serve (FCFS)**
- **Shortest Job First (SJF) â€” Preemptive & Non-Preemptive**
- **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)**
- **Round Robin (RR)**
- **Priority Scheduling â€” Preemptive & Non-Preemptive**
- **Multilevel Queue Scheduling**
- **Multilevel Feedback Queue Scheduling**
- **Gantt Chart generation** for each algorithm

Each implementation includes:
- Process structure definition
- Waiting time, turnaround time, and completion time calculations
- Example input/output
- Well-commented source code

### 2. Basic Linux Operations
- File management commands (`ls`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `cat`, `touch`, etc.)
- Directory navigation and manipulation (`cd`, `pwd`, `mkdir`, etc.)
- File permissions (`chmod`, `chown`)
- Process management (`ps`, `top`, `kill`)
- Input/Output redirection (`>`, `>>`, `<`, `|`)
- Shell scripting basics
